# Handwriting recognition
## Introduction
Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer to interpret hand written text as the characters. The goal of this project is to recognize numbers from images using a Naive Bayes classifier.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers that are based on Bayesâ€™ theorem. These algorithms work by combining the probabilities that an instance belongs to a class based on the value of a set of features. In this case, we will be testing if an image belongs to the class of the digits 0 to 9 based on the state of the pixels in the images.


## Part 1. Training images
We set a single hand written image size as 28x28 pixcels. Below is one of the hand written images used to train the model.
